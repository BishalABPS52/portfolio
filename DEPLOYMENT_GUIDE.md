# Deployment Guide - Vercel

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio to Vercel with all necessary configurations.

## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB Atlas Account** (Free tier available)
2. **Vercel Account** 
3. **GitHub Repository** (already set up)

## Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Sign up for a free account or log in
3. Create a new cluster:
   - Choose the free tier (M0 Sandbox)
   - Select a region close to your users
   - Name your cluster (e.g., "portfolio-cluster")

4. Set up database access:
   - Go to "Database Access" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add New Database User"
   - Create a user with username/password authentication
   - Give it "Read and write to any database" permissions
   - **Save the username and password** - you'll need them for the connection string

5. Set up network access:
   - Go to "Network Access" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Choose "Allow access from anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0) for Vercel deployment
   - Confirm the change

6. Get your connection string:
   - Go to "Database" â†’ "Connect" â†’ "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string (it looks like: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`)
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual password
   - Add your database name at the end: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/bishal-portfolio?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository: `BishalABPS52/portfolio`

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - In the import process, you'll see "Environment Variables" section
   - Add these variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/bishal-portfolio?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ADMIN_PASSWORD = admin123
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

   **Note:** Replace the MongoDB URI with your actual connection string from Atlas.

3. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete
   - Your site will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain if you have one
3. Follow Vercel's instructions to update your DNS settings

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Test the main site:**
   - Visit your deployed URL
   - Check that all sections load correctly
   - Test responsive design on mobile

2. **Test admin functionality:**
   - Go to `/admin` on your deployed site
   - Log in with your admin password
   - Test updating availability status
   - Verify changes are saved to MongoDB Atlas

## Environment Variables Summary

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Your MongoDB Atlas connection string | Database connection |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `admin123` (or your preferred password) | Admin panel access |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Environment mode |

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify TypeScript compilation passes locally with `npm run build`

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0
- Check that your connection string is correct
- Ensure the database user has proper permissions

### Environment Variable Issues
- Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables in Vercel
- Ensure all variables are set for Production environment
- Redeploy after adding/changing environment variables

## Post-Deployment Security

1. **Change Admin Password:**
   - Consider using a stronger password for production
   - Update the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable in Vercel

2. **MongoDB Security:**
   - Consider restricting IP access to Vercel's IP ranges (advanced)
   - Regularly rotate database credentials

## Monitoring

- Monitor your Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Check MongoDB Atlas for database usage and performance
- Set up alerts for any deployment failures

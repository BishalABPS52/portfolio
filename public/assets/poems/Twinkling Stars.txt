Twinkling Stars

In the dark night,
With a dazzling light,
Above us very high,
Stars twinkle in the sky .

Stars shine bright,
With amusing glowing light ,
Illuminate whole night,
Create jawbreaking sight ;

Decorate sky with luna,
Appear to be tiny like tuna,
But ,
Are the great energy sources ,
Made by unknown forces;

At Night :
Lying on the ground,
Looking above and around ,
Connecting those dots,
Sharing thoughts ;

Those days are still left.

Our mind should be beautiful and serene. Our life is unique and unchangeable. We can be as good as the flowers in the garden. We can climb that hill of success. There are still days left of our struggle and Our happiness is yet to come . Improve the present and become the future instead. Those days that have gone back will not come. If we make untiring efforts, a wave of joy will surely come. As a result, our future generations will rejoice. We still have to give the fruit of our parents' sweat. There are still days left to fulfill all our duties . The moments spent with friends are delightful. The moments in memory are unforgettable. Let's review our good days. Solve the problems of the future and the present unresolved. Time to stop, therefore, those days are gone. But there are still days to come
